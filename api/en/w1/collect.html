		<h1>Collect Data</h1>
        <br>
        <p>
            Data Collection is the process of gathering data (Numerical, text, video, audio etc), influenced by two major factors namely, the question that needs to be answered by the data scientist and the environment that the data scientist is working in!
        </p>
		<p>Process Breakdown</p>
        <p>
            <ol>
				<li>Define Data Requirements: Specify what data is needed, including
					<ul>
						<li>Variables of Interest: Define the specific variables to be measured.</li>
						<li>Format: Determine the required format of the data (e.g., numerical, categorical).</li>
						<li>Granularity: Decide the level of detail needed.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Identify Data Sources: Determine where the data will come from. Common sources include:
					<ul>
						<li>Surveys and Questionnaires: Collecting responses directly from individuals.</li>
						<li>Existing Databases: Using data from government databases, company records, or other organizations.</li>
						<li>Web Scraping: Extracting data from websites.</li>
						<li>Sensors and IoT Devices: Collecting data from physical devices.</li>
						<li>APIs: Gathering data from online services through Application Programming Interfaces.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Design Data Collection Methods: Plan how to collect the data.
					<ul>
						<li>Surveys/Interviews: Design questions and select respondents.</li>
						<li>Experiments: Design experiments to collect data under controlled conditions.</li>
						<li>Automated Data Collection: Set up systems for continuous data collection from sensors or web scraping.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Collect Data: Execute the data collection plan.
					<ul>
						<li>Manual Collection: Gathering data by hand, such as through interviews.</li>
						<li>Automated Collection: Using scripts, APIs, or sensors to gather data automatically.</li>
						<li>Log Data: Collecting logs from software applications or websites.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Ensure Data Quality: Verify the accuracy, completeness, and reliability of the data.
					<ul>
						<li>Data Cleaning: Remove or correct errors and inconsistencies.</li>
						<li>Validation: Ensure the data meets the required standards and specifications.</li>
						<li>Data Integration: Combine data from multiple sources if necessary.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Store Data: Organize and store the collected data for analysis.
					<ul>
						<li>Databases: Store structured data in databases.</li>
						<li>Data Lakes: Store large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data.</li>
						<li>Cloud Storage: Use cloud-based solutions for scalability and accessibility.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Document Data Collection Process: Maintain detailed records of how the data was collected, including:
					<ul>
						<li>Methodologies: Describe the methods and tools used.</li>
						<li>Protocols: Document any protocols or guidelines followed</li>
						<li>Challenges: Note any issues or challenges encountered during the collection process.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ol>
			The quality and reliability of the data collected directly impact the insights and conclusions drawn from data science projects. Therefore, meticulous planning and execution of data collection are crucial for successful data analysis and decision-making.

		<h2>Next Steps</h2>
		<p>
			We have collected data from various stored locations, time to deal with our data to [link:#api/en/w1/store Store Data].
