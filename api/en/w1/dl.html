        <br>
        <p>
            Deep Learning (DL) is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with many layers (deep neural networks) to model complex patterns in data. The primary tasks in DL include:
            <ol>
                <li>Image and Video Processing:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Image Classification: Assigning labels to images (e.g., identifying objects in images).</li>
                        <li>Object Detection: Detecting and locating objects within images or videos (e.g., face detection).</li>
                        <li>Image Segmentation: Partitioning an image into multiple segments (e.g., medical image analysis).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Natural Language Processing (NLP):
                    <ul>
                        <li>Text Classification: Categorizing text into predefined categories (e.g., sentiment analysis, spam detection).</li>
                        <li>Machine Translation: Translating text from one language to another (e.g., Google Translate).</li>
                        <li>Speech Recognition: Converting spoken language into text (e.g., voice assistants like Siri and Alexa).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Speech and Audio Processing:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Speech Synthesis: Generating human-like speech from text (e.g., text-to-speech systems).</li>
                        <li>Audio Classification: Categorizing audio clips into predefined categories (e.g., music genre classification).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Generative Modeling:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs): Creating new data samples that mimic the distribution of the training data (e.g., generating realistic images, deepfakes).</li>
                        <li>Variational Autoencoders (VAEs): Learning latent representations of data for tasks like image generation and anomaly detection.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Time Series Forecasting:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Predicting future values in a time series (e.g., stock prices, weather forecasting).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Robotics and Control:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Enabling robots to perceive their environment, make decisions, and perform tasks autonomously (e.g., autonomous driving, robotic surgery).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>
