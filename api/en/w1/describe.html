		<h1>Describe Data</h1>
        <br>
        <p>
            Data Description has two aspects. Data Visualising involves representing processed data using graphs, charts, diagrams, and other visualizations. Data Summarisation involves calculating various summary statistics like the mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and variance.
        </p>
        <ol>
			<li>Understanding the Context
				<ul>
					<li>Domain Knowledge: Understanding the field or industry the data is related to.</li>
					<li>Data Source: Knowing where the data comes from and how it was collected.</li>
					<li>Data Quality: Assessing the accuracy, completeness, and reliability of the data.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Descriptive Statistics
				<ul>
					<li>Measures of Central Tendency:
						<ul>
							<li>Mean: The average value of the dataset.</li>
							<li>Median: The middle value when the data is ordered.</li>
							<li>Mode: The most frequently occurring value in the dataset.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Measures of Dispersion:
						<ul>
							<li>Range: The difference between the maximum and minimum values.</li>
							<li>Variance: The average of the squared differences from the mean.</li>
							<li>Standard Deviation: The square root of the variance, representing the spread of the data.</li>
							<li>Interquartile Range (IQR): The range between the first quartile (25th percentile) and the third quartile (75th percentile).</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Measures of Shape:
						<ul>
							<li>Skewness: Describes the asymmetry of the data distribution.</li>
							<li>Kurtosis: Describes the "tailedness" of the data distribution.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Frequency Distribution:
						<ul>
							<li>Histograms: Show the distribution of numerical data by dividing the data into bins and counting the number of observations in each bin.</li>
							<li>Frequency Tables: Tabulate the number of occurrences of each value or category.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Data Visualization
				<ul>
					<li>Univariate Analysis (Analyzing a single variable):
						<ul>
							<li>Histograms: Show the frequency distribution of a single variable.</li>
							<li>Box Plots: Visualize the distribution, central tendency, and variability of a dataset.</li>
							<li>Pie Charts: Show the proportion of categories in a dataset.</li>
							<li>Bar Charts: Display the frequency or count of categorical data.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Bivariate Analysis (Analyzing two variables):
						<ul>
							<li>Scatter Plots: Show the relationship between two continuous variables.</li>
							<li>Line Charts: Display data points connected by straight lines, often used to show trends over time.</li>
							<li>Correlation Matrices: Show the correlation coefficients between pairs of variables.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Multivariate Analysis (Analyzing more than two variables):
						<ul>
							<li>Heatmaps: Visualize data in matrix form, where individual values are represented as colors.</li>
							<li>Pair Plots: Plot pairwise relationships in a dataset.</li>
							<li>3D Scatter Plots: Show the relationship between three continuous variables.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Data Distribution
				<ul>
					<li>Normal Distribution: A symmetric, bell-shaped distribution where most of the data points cluster around the mean.</li>
					<li>Uniform Distribution: All outcomes are equally likely, and each value within a certain range occurs with equal frequency.</li>
					<li>Skewed Distribution: A distribution where data points cluster more on one side of the mean (left or right skewed).</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Data Types
				<ul>
					<li>Numerical Data: Quantitative data that can be measured and assigned a numerical value.
						<ul>
							<li>Continuous: Can take any value within a range (e.g., height, weight).</li>
							<li>Discrete: Can take only specific values (e.g., number of students).</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Categorical Data: Qualitative data that can be divided into categories.
						<ul>
							<li>Nominal: Categories without a natural order (e.g., gender, color).</li>
							<li>Ordinal: Categories with a natural order (e.g., rankings, satisfaction levels).</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Summary Statistics
				<ul>
					<li>Count: The number of observations in the dataset.</li>
					<li>Sum: The total sum of all values for a numerical variable.</li>
					<li>Minimum and Maximum: The smallest and largest values in the dataset.</li>
					<li>Percentiles: Values below which a certain percentage of observations fall (e.g., 25th percentile, 50th percentile, 75th percentile).</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			By applying these methods, data scientists can gain valuable insights into the data, identify patterns and trends, and make informed decisions for further analysis or modeling.
