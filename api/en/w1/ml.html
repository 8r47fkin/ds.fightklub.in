		<h1>Machine Learning</h1>
        <br>
        <p>
            Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on building systems that can learn from and make decisions based on data. The primary tasks in ML involve:
            <ol>
                <li>Supervised Learning:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Classification: Assigning inputs to predefined categories (e.g., spam detection in emails, image recognition).</li>
                        <li>Regression: Predicting a continuous output (e.g., predicting house prices, stock market trends).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Unsupervised Learning:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Clustering: Grouping similar data points together (e.g., customer segmentation, document clustering).</li>
                        <li>Dimensionality Reduction: Reducing the number of features while retaining essential information (e.g., PCA, t-SNE).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Semi-Supervised Learning:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Using both labeled and unlabeled data for training (e.g., combining a small labeled dataset with a large unlabeled dataset to improve learning).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Reinforcement Learning:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Training agents to make sequences of decisions by rewarding desired actions and punishing undesired ones (e.g., game playing, robotics).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Anomaly Detection:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Identifying unusual patterns that do not conform to expected behavior (e.g., fraud detection, network security).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Recommendation Systems:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Suggesting products, services, or information to users based on their preferences and behavior (e.g., movie recommendations, product recommendations).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>
